We're a passionate team of creatives and techies working at Deutsche Bahn providing the [DB UX Design System (you need to be logged-in to the DB Marketingportal)](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/db-ux-design-system).

[DB UX Design System Version 3](https://design-system.deutschebahn.com/) is the successor of the [DB UI ecosystem](https://db-ui.github.io/#en), that were the technical products out of this DB UX Design System Version 2.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
