### Hi there 👋

We're a passionate team of creatives and techies working at Deutsche Bahn providing the [DB UX Design System (you need to be logged-in to the DB Marketingportal)](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/db-ux-design-system).

We're currently finalizing a new version of the [DB UX Design System Version 3](https://db-ux-design-system.github.io/), so please stay tuned.

The [DB UI ecosystem](https://db-ui.github.io/#en) are the technical products out of this Design System Version 2.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
